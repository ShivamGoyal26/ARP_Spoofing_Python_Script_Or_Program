# Now what is the ARP Spoofing, this is similar to the man in the middle attack here bascially
# All the information of the client like what he is seraching,watching,entering passwords etc
# all these details will pass through our machine then we can drop, modify etc with that
#     information after this info will go to the router and then so on ....
#
# and when the server respond then router will give the response to us then similary
# we can modify,drop etc with the respone and then pass it to the client
# 
# basically here we make fool to router that i am the client
# and to client that i am the router
